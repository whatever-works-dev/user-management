# User management

## Case 

Create a RESTful API for managing user registration, authentication, and profile management using Node.js and NestJS.

## Requirements

1. Set Up:

- Initialize a new NestJS project.
- Use TypeScript for type safety.
- Set up a simple SQLite/PostgreSQL database or store data in-memory instead of using a database.

2. Entities:

- User:
    - `id`
    - `username`
    - `password`
    - `created_at`
    - `updated_at`

3. Functionality:

- User Registration and Authentication:
    - Implement user registration with hashed passwords.
    - Implement JWT-based authentication.
    - Implement user login and logout.
- User Profile Management:
    - Allow users to view their profile.
    - Allow users to update their profile information (e.g., username, password).

4. Other criteria:

- Provide a README file with instructions on how to set up and run the project.
- Do not forget to follow best practices for clean code, reusability, and maintainability.
- What do you think about testing?
